This Sample Android Project is a quick and dirty demonstration the usage of Firebase MLKIT with Android Things.

You need to insert your own Google-Services.json file obtained from your Firebase Console.

I have used samples available on Github will post links to those sources soon.

The Goal was to have a sort of Camera Preview along with ability to show the detections over the
preview.

This just works and I have not gone deep into best practices etc.

Feel free to use it in your project and modify the code.

I don't have time/knowledge about pull request so won't be maintaining this.

Comments are welcome.

You need to use latest preview version of Android Studio
